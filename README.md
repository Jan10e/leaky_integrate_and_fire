# Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons

This repo contains code for simulating leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons in different coding languages (MatLab, Julia, Python). The code includes for single LIF neurons, LIF neurons that are coupled in an excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network, and are coupled in large networks of different ring structures.

## Code
Some of the current MatLab code is based on code from [faezeamin](https://github.com/faezeamin/NC-Network-of-LIF-Neurons-Coupled-by-Electrical-Synapses), however, is adjusted for readability and own purpose. In addition, MatLab code also contains the [SimLIFNet function](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50339-easily-simulate-custom-networks-of-lif-neurons) created by Zachary Danziger.

## Getting started

Either download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jan10e/LIF/
```

Then navigate to the downloaded folder:

```
cd /path/to/LIF
```

You will need to repeat these steps if I update the code.
